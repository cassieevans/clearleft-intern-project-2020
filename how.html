                            There is a significant body of research quantifying

                            wanted to go deeper into why people see GPs for
                            minor ailments, and when and why people use other

                                be something more serious.

                                nurses, and GPs. We started with warm-up
                                sketching exercises to make everyone feel
                                comfortable with sketching, and to help them

                        <h4>Deciding on the outcome</h4>
                        <p>
                            Due to the scale and complex nature of our concept
                            and limited time we have left we decided to make a
                            film to communicate the vision of the project.

                        <h4>Storyboarding the film</h4>
                        <p>
                            Aware that the result of the project was a high
                            level vision we knew that telling the story of how
                            things are now, and how they could be was crucial to
                            communicating the value. Sketching the flow of
                            scenes needed to share this idea was invaluable, and
                            gave us the base from which to add text to aid our
                            storytelling. It also helped us develop only the
                            necessary prototype screens needed in the film.

                        <h4>Shooting and editing</h4>
                        <p>
                            Shooting all the scenes in different locations in
                            one day was one of the biggest challenges we faced
                            during this internship. However, the shooting day
                            went smoothly as we carefully and meticulously
                            planned all logistics to ensure we were fully
                            prepared for the shoot We only had one day for the
                            complete editing of our video, so likewise we
                            gathered everything we might have needed prior to
                            this day to successfully speed up the process.
