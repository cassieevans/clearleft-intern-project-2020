                            We were astounded to learn that a third of people
                            each year admit to seeing a GP for a minor condition
                            that they could have treated at home. Interviews
                            with GP surgery staff and a survey of the public
                            echoed this.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h5>subtitle</h5>
                        <p>
                            We discovered that it’s not a lack of desire to
                            self-care. We found it was anxiety, lack of
                            confidence, and forgetfulness that ‘got in the way’
                            of self-care; people were giving up too early, and
                            too easily.

                        <p>
                            We saw this as a fascinating, and underserved design
                            problem. We live in an age of information, and the
                            NHS provides carefully curated advice on health
                            conditions. But how could we design to increase
                            self-treatment, and reduce GP visits for minor
                            conditions? This was the focus for our project.
