                                It was a pleasure to work with this energetic
                                and imaginative internship team, to develop a
                                concept that would aid the general practitioner
                                in managing an ever increasing workload.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The brief was intentionally left open, which
                                necessitated a considerable amount of tenacity
                                and creativity to try and develop a truly
                                beneficial adjunct to the complex process of
                                initial assessment and management of urgent care
                                needs in general practice.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Through the use of primary research, actively
                                engaging with the local practice patient
                                population as well as the larger population, a
                                tool was developed to aid the management of
                                patient self care, taking into account
                                pre-existing tools and platforms, and
                                identifying a gap in the presentation and
                                engagement with the individual patient.

                                It is hoped to take this concept forward, but it
                                is a testament to the determination of the team
                                that they saw this through to the concept stage,
                                by effectively interfacing with the complex fast
                                paced environment of today's general practice.

                                Clearleft enabled this process with engagement
                                by their professionals at key stages and
                                providing project management support throughout
