            The concept is a web-app and service design, created to work in
            tandem and integrated into a GP practice. Here we walk you through
            the vision of the solution from the patients’ perspective.

              <h5>Being unwell</h5>
              <p>
                Most people get minor illnesses from time to time, and sometimes
                more often.
              </p>
              <p>
                A third of people end up at their GP surgeries for conditions
                they could treat themselves because they want to check it’s not
                more serious or because they think it’s gone on for too long.
                People care about ‘saving the NHS’ and recognise responsibility
                for their health, however often this doesn’t translate into
                action.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using existing behaviour, Self Treat is delivered to these
                people who seek medical help through pharmacy card, calls to the
                GP surgery and self referral.

                    Patients need easy to reach, trusted support and
                    encouragement to self-care. Self Treat provides this with a
                    simple text message after a call with clinical or
                    non-clinical staff (depending on the need).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The app adopts familiar NHS branding to emphasise
                    trustworthiness, and by using staff support and clinical
                    knowledge to help confirm diagnosis for those that need it,
                    sending condition specific treatment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It also overcomes simple barriers like lack of time for
                    doctors to provide self-care advice and patients forgetting
                    verbal advice. Integrated, trusted and easy.

                    <h5>Pharmacy</h5>
                    <p>
                      About a third of us go to the pharmacy when unwell. We’ll
                      often have a chat with a staff member or pharmacist, and
                      buy some medications to help symptoms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Although half of us go online, mainly to find treatment.
                      One way people are directed to Self Treat is via a
                      pharmacy condition card alongside your medication. This
                      gives crucial information regarding timeline and red flags
                      into the hands of people who are unwell.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It uses the trust people put in pharmacist staff to
                      achieve buy in, and takes people directly to treatment so
                      these self-carers keep self-treating and don’t end up at
                      the doctor.

              <h5>Self referral</h5>
              <p>
                One of the ultimate aims of this project is to give confidence
                to patients in treating minor conditions themselves by using
                Self Treat to take ownership of their health.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h5>Triggers</h5>
              <p>
                Information online can be overwhelming and contradictory. If
                people access the NHS website they find well worded, clear
                information if they know the condition.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, wherever you go, for minor ailments it’s a lot of
                generic do’s and don’ts, and possible causes, many of which are
                not relevant to you. You need to sift through this information,
                and make a guess on what might be causing your condition. It
                might not always be possible to prevent the condition next time
                if you’re not aware of the causes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Self Treat uses the reliable NHS information to offer the short
                term causes of the condition (i.e. spicy food before
                indigestion) as well as the longer term (i.e. being overweight).
                By avoiding the triggers the user can make more effective and
                manageable changes in their lifestyle.
              </p>
              <p>
                The data is fed into History enabling more clarity on when and
                how severe symptoms occurred. Symptoms to watch out for are
                clear on the landing page as absence of these concerning
                symptoms will help users feel reassured.

              <h5>Treatment</h5>
              <p>
                Self Treat gives you relevant treatment advice. For example by
                adding triggers, treatment becomes tailored. No more
                recommendations to avoid alcohol if you don’t drink, or lose
                weight if you’re weight is healthy. You might also feel like
                your experience of the condition might be different due to
                various reasons, so the app, pays attention to descriptions of
                symptoms to be clear on what feels ‘normal’.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using the trusted NHS advice into a “self-treat prescription”
                Self Treat, delivers less overwhelming advice, and turns them
                into more personalised actions.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the key aspects of Self Treat is that it gives you a
                timeline for when you’re expected to feel better. This way, you
                feel confident in treating your condition yourself for the given
                time period.

              <p>
                We all know that changing our routine is easy to forget. 30 days
                to form a new habit, right?
              </p>
              <p>
                But we know people don’t like endless reminders. So we believe
                in a happy medium: a daily, timely reminder based on you
                self-treatment prescription, prompting to pay attention to
                triggers, or generally to take care of yourself.

              <h5>Evening check ins</h5>
              <p>
                It’s common to not be able to remember when you had symptoms,
                what you tried, and what could have been the trigger.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yet that’s exactly the information a doctor will ask you in a
                consultation; how long have you had it, and how often?
              </p>

              <p>
                Self Treat sends an evening check in during your illness or
                period of recurring symptoms to ask ‘Have you had indigestion
                today? If you have, spending less than a minute noting any of
                the possible condition triggers builds a history.

              <h5>History</h5>
              <p>
                The History is the hub of insight. It allows you to look back
                and see when, how often, and how severely you were unwell or had
                symptoms.
              </p>
              <p>
                The insight that minor conditions can give you about your body
                is overlooked, so it helps you have an accurate history to spot
                recurring illnesses resulting from immune system dysfunction, or
                issues of recurring illness.
              </p>
              <p>
                It helps you recognise common triggers, giving you a more
                manageable approach to symptom avoidance. If your symptoms have
                been going on for a certain amount of time it prompts you to see
                the doctor, and when you do, you have a clear summary of the
                illness to show your doctor, saving them time and helping them
                treat you better.

            The concept solution we designed was based on research carried out
            with a GP surgery and with the public. along with data from existing
            government and academic research.

            We hope the project will serve as a little food for thought for
            anyone excited by user centred design solutions to increase
            efficiency in the NHS and empower better health outcomes. We also
            hope to see this project taken on and explored further.
