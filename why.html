          <p class="intro">
            We think self-care is an underserved design challenge. And we were
            convinced by our research that there was an opportunity to solve a
            real problem. Technology is making behavior change easier and by
            focusing on this area we aimed to have an outcome that would serve
            both the GP surgery and patients.

            The goal was to design a solution for primary healthcare (GP
            surgeries) that would enhance the network of primary caregivers,
            improve efficiency, and/or ‘reduced the load’.
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution could be fully designed or conceptual, and was not
            limited to digital.
          </p>

          <h3 class="underline">The Problem</h3>
          <p>
            We were astounded to learn that a third of people each year admit to
            seeing a GP for a minor condition that they could have treated at
            home. Interviews with GP surgery staff and a survey of the public
            echoed this.
          </p>
          <p>
            We discovered that it’s not a lack of desire to self-care. We found
            it was anxiety, lack of confidence, and forgetfulness that ‘got in
            the way’ of self-care; people were giving up too early, and too
            easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            We saw this as a fascinating, and underserved design problem. We
            live in an age of information, and the NHS provides carefully
            curated advice on health conditions. But how could we design to
            increase self-treatment, and reduce GP visits for minor conditions?
            This was the focus for our project.
