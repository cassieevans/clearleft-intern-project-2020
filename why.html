                        The goal was to design a solution for primary healthcare
                        (GP surgeries) that would enhance the network of primary
                        caregivers, improve efficiency, and/or ‘reduced the
                        load’.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The solution could be fully designed or conceptual, and
                        was not limited to digital.

                    <p>
                        We were astounded to learn that a third of people each
                        year admit to seeing a GP for a minor condition that
                        they could have treated at home. Interviews with GP
                        surgery staff and a survey of the public echoed this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We discovered that it’s not a lack of desire to
                        self-care. We found it was anxiety, lack of confidence,
                        and forgetfulness that ‘got in the way’ of self-care;
                        people were giving up too early, and too easily.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We saw this as a fascinating, and underserved design
                        problem. We live in an age of information, and the NHS
                        provides carefully curated advice on health conditions.
                        But how could we design to increase self-treatment, and
                        reduce GP visits for minor conditions? This was the
                        focus for our project.
